New to Modding
==============

¬Give classes meaningful names, DecorativeStone is much more informative that Stone2 etc.

¬Ensure all class/file names are unique, a good practice may be to add your initials or username to the end of all your files   or classes.  

¬If in doubt, follow the example classes, they will contain all the information needed to implement new features into the mod.

¬Check recipes in-game before giving it to your item, this should help stop recipe conflicts.              

¬Add comments to your code, using // or */, so everyone knows what your new code does, you could also include your name as a    credit. For example:

              // Decorative stone block, purely cosmetic block with no other features.
              //Made by Codex, 17/09/2014
              
 Your comments can be as indepth as you want, but please include at least a simple description of what your code does.

¬Try not to create a feature that already exists or is over powered, nobody really wants to craft diamonds using a piece of dirt.

¬Ensure everything compiles and works properly before submitting back to the repository.

Experienced Modders
===================

If possible, try adding extra comments to your code. Explaining how the code works should help inexperience modders overcome larger obstacles,such as implementing GUIs or Network functionality. I know this isn't always possible but if you could try I'd be very grateful!
